# Natural History of Biological Mo/W Usage
## Summary
Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential nutrient for most living organisms, but the history of biological Mo usage remains enigmatic. We use phylogenomic methods to identify the earliest Mo-using biological processes and outline the sequential stages in the evolution of Mo-using enzymes over time. This repository contains the data and code to reproduce some of our analyses.
